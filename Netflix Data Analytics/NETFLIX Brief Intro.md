## Business Requirements/Task Overview:
 >We would want to first analyze the data-frame to view some column aggregation, looking at the summary, count of null values, number of unique values in a column, etc.
 
 #### After Satisfying the above, we can then head into solving the tasks below.
 
 1. Is there any Duplicate Record in this dataset? If yes, then remove the duplicate records.
 2. Is there any Null Value present in any column? Show with Heat-map.
 3. For 'House of Cards', what is the Show Id and Who is the Director of this show?
 4. In which year highest number of the TV Shows & Movies were released ? Show with Bar Graph.
