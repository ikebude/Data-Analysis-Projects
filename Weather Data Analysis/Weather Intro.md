## Project Title: Weather Data Analytics Project.

**Overview:** The purpose of this project is to analyze the Weather data for a particular weather location to gain useful insights on Weather Calculations to improve Weather Tracking services.

Here,The Weather Dataset is a time-series data set with per-hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location. It records Temperature, Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, and Conditions.

This data is available as a CSV file.

## Scope:
This project will focus on analyzing Weather Data from January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2012.

## Data Column Details.
+ Date/Time - The date and Time the record  was taken.
+ Temp_C - The temperature as as the time the record was taken.
+ Dew Point - The Due Point Temperature as at the time the record was taken.
+ Rel Hum_% - Measured in Percentage, This is the Relative Humidity of the Weather during the time the record was taken.
+ Wind Speed_km/h - The speed of the wind during recording time.
+ Visibility_km - The measurement of the Visibility calculated in kilometer.
+ Press_kPa - Rhe Pressure of the Weather during recording.
+ Weather - The Weather Condition during Record (e.g Fog, Snow, Dew ).

## Business Requirements/Task Overview:
 *We would want to first analyze the data-frame to view some column aggregation, looking at the summary, count of null values, number of unique values in a column, etc.*
 #### After Satisfying the above, we can then head into solving the tasks below.
 1.  Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.
 2.  Find the number of times when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.
 3.  Find the number of times when the 'Wind Speed was exactly 4 km/h'.
 4.  Find out all the Null Values in the data.
 5.  Rename the column name 'Weather' of the data frame to 'Weather Condition'.
 6.  What is the mean 'Visibility' ?
 7.  What is the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure'  in this data?
 8.  Whats is the Variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data?
 9.  Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
 10. Find all instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.
 11. What is the Mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'?
 12. What is the Minimum & Maximum value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'?
 13. Show all the Records where Weather Condition is Fog.
 14. Find all instances when 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.
 15. Find all instances when A. 'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50' or B. 'Visibility is above 40'.
 
## Deliverables:
+ A  Python Script containing generated coding for showing insights on the Weather Dataset
+ An  R Script containing generated coding for showing insights on the Weather Dataset
+ A report containing insights on Weather Dataset (e.g Unique Weather Numbers, Filtered Table, etc.)

## Conclusion
The data analytics project for Weather is an important initiative that will help the Project Manager to understand its movements along certain days and times. The external consultant will work closely with the Project team to ensure that the project is successful and delivers the expected results.
