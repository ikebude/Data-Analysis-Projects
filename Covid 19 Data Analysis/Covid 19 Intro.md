## Project Title: Covid 19 Data Analytics Project.

**Task Overview:** The purpose of this project is to analyze the available data that shows the Corona Virus Disease that took over the World in December 2019. The Outbreak Started from China and went accross other parts of the world, Causing lockdown in most Governmental states. The ``` CovidData.csv ``` contains The total number of recorded cases accross Countries and their states, calculating the number of Recoveries and Deaths, It was recorded on the 29th of April 2020.

The Data was made available by Wanda for this Project, It is saved in a csv file with the name "CovidData".

## Project Objectives:
This project will focus on analyzing how the outbreak of the Corona virus affected each countries within a stipulated period of time. We are looking to understand;
 > How much Death occured compared to the number of Recoveries, What number of affected people comes from the whole population, Which Country is being affected the Most.
 
If there's any chance for further question, there will be space to answer them.

## Data Column Details.
Here are the names of the column with a brief info;

+ Date: This is the date the Record was taken for Analysis, All the dates is recorded on the 29 of april 2020.
+ State: The states of the country tha the recored was taken from.
+ Region: This is the Country that the Record was taken from, The countries is from Accross the entire world.
+ Confirmed: The total Number of Confirmed Cases in a particular Country or Region.
+ Deaths: The total number of deaths from the Recorded cases.
+ Recovered: The total number of People that recovered their Cases.

## Business Requirements/Task Overview:
 *We would want to first analyze the data-frame to view some column aggregation, looking at the summary, count of null values, number of unique values in a column, etc.*
 #### After Satisfying the above, we can then head into solving the tasks below.
 
1. Show the number of Confirmed , Deaths and Recovered cases in each Region.
2. Remove all the records where Confirmed Cases is Less Than 10.
3. In which Region, maximum number of Confirmed cases were recorded?
4. In which Region, minimum number of Deaths cases were recorded?
5. How many Confirmed , Deaths & Recovered cases were reported from India till 29 April 2020?
6. Sort the entire data wrt No. of Confirmed cases in ascending order.
7. Sort the entire data wrt No. of Recovered cases in descending order.

## Deliverables:
+ A  Python Script containing generated coding for showing insights on the Covid 19 Dataset
+ An interactive dashboard containing important KPI's and the rest of unanswered questions from the Covid dataset.
+ An  R Script containing generated coding for showing insights on the Covid Dataset
+ A report containing insights on Weather Dataset.

## Constraints:
- The data cannot be shared with unauthorized personnel.
- The data cannot be modified or altered in any way.
- The project must comply with data privacy regulations.
- The project must be completed within the allocated time and budget.

## Conclusion
The data analytics project for Corona Virus is an important initiative that will help the Project Manager. The external consultant will work closely with the Project team to ensure that the project is successful and delivers the expected results.
