# Data-Analytics-Projects

In this detailed Repository, I executed quries and performed Explanatory Data Analysis on datasets collected across various websites like Kaggle, Github, Terapad. The Main aim  of the Projects was to understand the totality of the data and clearly understand the trends in certain column variables.

The Datasets in this projects were cleaned with MySQL workbench for proper loading, We did the EDA on programming languages softwares, *Python* and *R* in particular, creating markdiwn and Notebooks for Report deliveries.

The Projects in this repository provided valuable insight that an Analyst can use to get further into what part of the datasets he is looking to put most of his time and analysis into.

If you're looking for a place to begin your knowledge in Python and R programming languages, then this should be a great start.
