## Project Title: London Housing Data Analytics Project.

**Task Overview:** The purpose of this project is to analyze the available data that shows the Monthly number of House sales in a particular area in London, alongside the average price sold and the total Number of Crimes During the the time. The Data range is from January 1995 to December 2019/January 2020

This data is available as a CSV file, downloaded from Kaggle. We are going to analyze the Dataframe.

## Project Objectives:
This project will focus on analyzing how the increase in the Hose sales happened over the Year in Some places in London. This project is for beginners and for those who want to know how we analyze big data with Python..

## Data Column Details.
Here are the names of the column with a brief info;

+ date: This shows the date and time of the data sets, recorded in Months.
+ area: This is the area of London that the Dataset was taken, e.g city of London, etc.
+ average_price: The Monthly average price of the houses sold during a particular month.
+ code: This should be the codes.
+ houses_sold: The total Number of Houses Sold in a particular month.
+ no_of_crimes: The total number of crimes committed in the particular area under the Particular Month.


## Business Requirements/Task Overview:
 >We would want to first analyze the data-frame to view some column aggregation, looking at the summary, count of null values, number of unique values in a column, etc.
 #### After Satisfying the above, we can then head into solving the tasks below.
 
1. Convert the Datatype of 'Date' column to Date-Time format.
2. Add a new column ''year'' in the dataframe, which contains years only.
3. Add a new column ''month'' as 2nd column in the dataframe, which contains month only.
4. Remove the columns 'year' and 'month' from the dataframe.
5. Show all the records where 'No. of Crimes' is 0. And, how many such records are there?
6. What is the maximum & minimum 'average_price' per year in england ?
7. What is the Maximum & Minimum No. of Crimes recorded per area?
8. Show the total count of records of each area, where average price is less than 100000.

## Deliverables:
+ A  Python Script containing generated coding for showing insights on the London Housing Dataset
+ An  R Script containing generated coding for showing insights on the Housing Dataset
+ A report containing insights on Housing Dataset.

## Constraints:
- The data cannot be shared with unauthorized personnel.
- The data cannot be modified or altered in any way.
- The project must comply with data privacy regulations.
- The project must be completed within the allocated time and budget.

## Conclusion
The external consultant will work closely with the Project team to ensure that the project is successful and delivers the expected results.
